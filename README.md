This first project at 42 Abu Dhabi was about creating our very own c-library.  This project is about understanding the way these functions work in c as well as implementing and learning to use them. Some of the functions are from the standard libc, others are useful functions that aren't in the standard libc but will be important in future projects. The functions are about manipulationg strings and memory in the mandatory part and linked lists in the bonus parts.
